# odin-landing-page
Project provided by The Odin Project https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page

This project will be my first attempt at creating an entire web page, from a given design. 

Two images have been provided. One depicts the completed site, while the other adds details about fonts and colors.

I will be using the knowledge gained thus far, and researching additional information as needed.

The point of this project is to create something from scratch, rather than perfect replication.
